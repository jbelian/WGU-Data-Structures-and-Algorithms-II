# Data Structures and Algorithms II
This was a course on data structures and algorithms, the final project of which was to solve a real programming problem by applying what I studied. The mock scenario of the project was a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem -- the algorithm I wrote routed all deliveries in a way that met all delivery requirements and deadlines while also traveling a sufficiently small number of miles. The [Core Algorithm Overview](/Core%20Algorithm%20Overview.pdf) describes and justifies the decisions I made in response to the project requirements and guidelines.
